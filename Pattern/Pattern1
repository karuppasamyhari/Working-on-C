/*
First we can print the number in a specific pattern like 
1 1 1 1 
2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4
Note that in our requirement there is additional one value added to the every row
(i.e if we give the input as 4 then for odd index row plus one value is added to row
number and it added at the end of the row. if it is even row plus one value is added to row 
number and it added at the begining of the row.)
1 1 1 1 2
3 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 4
5 4 4 4 4
